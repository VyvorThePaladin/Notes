# MAL: Malware Introductory

+ When analyzing malware, consider the following:
	- Point of Entry (PoE)
	- Indicators of Compromise
	- How does it work?
	- Can we prevent further infection?

+ Malware can be classified as Targeted and Mass Campaign.

+ Abstract steps of a malware attack:
	- Delivery
	- Execution
	- Maintaining persistence
	- Propagation

+ Two fingerprint categories:
	- Host-based signatures
	- Network-based signatures

+ Two categories of analyzing malware:
	- Static Analysis
	- Dynamic Analysis

+ The hex header of an executable is always "4D 5A".

+ Packing is a form of obfuscation that malware authors use to prevent analysis.

+ Disassemblers reverse the compiled code of a program from machine code to assembly.
+ Debuggers facilitate execution of the program - where the analyst can step through the program execution.
